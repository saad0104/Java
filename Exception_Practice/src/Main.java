// Event Handling is a mechanism to control the events and to decide what should happen after an event occur.
//  To handle the events, Java follows the Delegation Event model. 
// It has Sources and Listeners.
// Source --> Events are generated from the source. eg. button, checkbox, list, manulist, scroolbar.
// Listeners -->> Interfaces responsible for handling events.
